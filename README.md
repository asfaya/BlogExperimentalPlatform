# Blog Experimental Platform

Project created to create an experimental blogging platform

The idea is to use it as a showcase for the way I usually create projects (which might not necessarily be best practices)
Always eager to learn, I'm open to suggestion.

Eventually with time, who knows, it may even become a real blogging platform.
